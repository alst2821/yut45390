Plotter program

invocation:

java -jar plotter.jar

Listens on port 7070 for incoming UDP packets with the following format:
Byte Use
0    16-bit sequenceno (msb)
1    16-bit sequenceno (lsb)
2-4    three bytes for 24-bit value (1 of 32)
5-97   three bytes * 32 for 24-bit values (2 to 32 of 32)
98-254 padding

The plots show the values of a selectable 24-bit conversion scaled from
0 to 16777215 (24 bits) and displayed as percentage of 16777215 (0 to 100%).

Testing program
===============

java -cp plotter.jar ox.net.udpsend.simulator.Generator

Generates udp packets to test plotting program. Sends 700 packets with a "V" shape
from 0 to the maximum for channel 1 (value 1 of 32).
